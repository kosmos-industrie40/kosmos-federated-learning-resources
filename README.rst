DESCRIPTION
===========
This repository implements a machine learning model that predicts the Remaining Useful Lifetime (RUL) of a bearing, wrapped as an python package.
Currently, only the FFNN and CNN models created in `Alexander Lontke's Thesis <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p1LfnUwQWT5ujGujojtpgLuDQPxBWYI0/view?usp=sharing>`_ are available.
The repository also contains a dataloader for the `processed data of Bearing Data Set <http://s3-de-central.profitbricks.com/bearing_data/processed_data.zip>`_, an adaptation of the FEMTO-ST Bearings Dataset [NECT2012]_.
See section `DATASET`_ for further information on the modifications made.


DATASET
=======
The utilized dataset is a modified version of the FEMTO-ST Bearings Dataset [NECT2012]_. 

Changes:

- Temperature measurements were dropped
- For each bearing, all vibration measurement files (``acc\_*.csv``) were combined into two files (*spectra.csv* and *features.csv*; each ``acc\_*.csv`` file represents one row)
- **spectra.csv**: Spectral transformation of horizontal and vertical vibration using a short term fourier transformation + RUL.
- **features.csv**: Features calculated regarding horizontal and vertical vibration: 

  - mean
  - maximum
  - minimum
  - root_mean_square
  - peak_to_peak_value
  - skewness
  - kurtosis
  - variance
  - peak_factor
  - change_coefficient
  - clearance_factor
  - abs_energy
  - shannon_entropy
  - permutation_entropy
  - spectral_entropy
  - frequency_mean
  - frequency_maximum
  - frequency_minimum
  - frequency_root_mean_square
  - frequency_peak_to_peak_value
  - frequency_skewness
  - frequency_kurtosis
  - frequency_variance
  - frequency_peak_factor
  - frequency_change_coefficient
  - frequency_clearance_factor
  - frequency_abs_energy
  - RUL
